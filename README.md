# OpenManus Project

This is a minimal implementation of an OpenManus-inspired project. OpenManus is an open-source framework for building general AI agents.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env` and add your API keys

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Features

- Simple web interface for interacting with the agent
- Basic API endpoint for agent interactions
- Expandable architecture for adding more tools and capabilities

## Next Steps

- Implement actual LLM integration
- Add tool plugins for various capabilities
- Implement proper agent memory and context management
- Add more advanced UI features
